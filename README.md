# Data-Collection-Pipeline
In this project we will scrap the protein data from website called Myprotein by using python and selenium
Developed a module that scraped data from various sources using Selenium 
Curated a database with information about <the website you chose> and stored it on an AWS RDS database using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
Performed unit testing and integration testing on the application to ensure that the package published to Pypi is working as expected
Used Docker to containerise the application and deployed it to an EC2 instance
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to push a new Docker image
Monitored the container using Prometheus and created dashboards to visualise those metrics using Grafana
